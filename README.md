# General practice with remote repos.

## I am also using _this file_ to practice writing **Markdown**! :triumph:

1. One
1. Two
1. Three

- Testing
- Out
- Some
- Bullets!

~~It's like I'm back on GameFAQs!~~

- [x] Practice some Markdown
- [x] Work hard every single day
- [ ] GIT GUD?

```javascript
const message = `Hello world~!`;
const preamble = `What better way to test your knowledge than with a "`;
const postable = `" code?`;
//I'm pretty sure you can chain concats like this, right?
let output = preamble.concat(message).concat(postamble);

console.log(output);
```
